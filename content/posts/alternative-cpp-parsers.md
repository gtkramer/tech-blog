## Lemon

[Lemon](http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/readme_lemon_tutorial.html) is an interesting alternative because it’s syntax is reminiscent of Flex and bison. It could be considered an improved version of these GNU tools because:
Lemon using a different grammar syntax which is less prone to programming errors (so the authors claim)
The parser generated by Lemon is re-entrant (which makes it thread-safe)
Lemon includes the concept of a non-terminal destructor (which makes it much easier to write a parser that does not leak memory)

However, deciding to not use it because of the awkwardness of code generators that then need to ultimately interface with the rest of an application somehow.

## Boost Spirit

After a search of what else was out there for C++ parsing, [Boost Spirit](http://boost-spirit.com/home/) came up as an intersting alternative. After reading the documentation, I’ve decided to use Boost Spirit because:

* Part of Boost, a library which was already planned for use in the project
* Built-in parsers for trivial datatypes, mainly float, which competely describe the datatype for STL files.
* Grammar definitions are C+±executable, no awkward code generators
* Straight-forward interface between parsing code and program code, to easily consume the data that was parsed in a format that the program can easily understand
* Mature, has gone through numerous architecture revisions
* Very well documented with numerous full working examples provided in a tutorial-like manner
* I feel confident that I could get a working test STL parser up and running in a few hours with Spirit Boost, much better than the time it took try to get up and running with flex and bison.
